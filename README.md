## Instruction 
You can follow the instruction below or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqSEqUk2kgg). It sould be easy :).  
### Patent Fetcher
(1) Insert PN (2) Filtering conditions (3) Information to be fetched (4) PDF type to be downloaded (5) Table  
<img src="./pic/ins.png">

1. Insert the patent numbers (PNs) to be processed in following ways:  
 Â (a) Choose a **CSV file with PNs in the first coulumn** ([example](https://github.com/mattwang44/USPTO-PatFT-Web-Crawler/blob/master/PN_sample.CSV)).  
   (b) **Search with query**. (The query should examined on PatFT.)  
   The PNs should be shown in the table.

2. (Optional) Filtering the shown PNs with **setting the patent types, range of application date & issue date**.  
   The filtered PNs are also shown on the table but will be deleted in the end of this process.

3. **Fetching the information** of patents shown in the table by web crawling.  

4. Download **PDF of full-text or drawing section** (or both simultaneously) of patents shown in the table.

5. The **table can be saved** as a CSV file anytime.  

### Browser

In the second page, you can insert PN to show the PatFT web of this patent or open PDF with your default browser.

## Caution
1. The program has some problems when fetching information of the patents issued before 1976. Still working on it.
2. Searching with long query takes a lot of time, same as it takes on PatFT ([example](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&p=1&f=S&l=50&Query=%28%28%28CPC%2FA62B%24+OR+CPC%2FB65H%24%29+OR+CPC%2FF16D%24%29+OR+CPC%2FB66D%24%29+AND+%28%28brak%24+OR+lock%24%29+OR+%28retract%24+OR+rewind%24%29%29+AND+%28%28%28lifeline+OR+lanyard%29+OR+%22safety+line%22%29+OR+cable%29&d=PTXT)). I tried using threading in the program but it leads to more time consumed, and multiprocessing leads to bad connection. If you have a long query with less than 500 results, copying the patents number to a CSV file on your own and insert the file sould be faster.  
3. If you encountered any problems or have any suggestion (like adding other function), feel free to [contact me](http://mattwang44.wixsite.com/main/contact)!
